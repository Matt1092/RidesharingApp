- **TMUberDelivery**: Simulates a food delivery service with attributes for restaurant and food order ID.
- **TMUberRegistered**: Registers all drivers and users through file input.
- **TMUberRide**: Simulates a ride service with attributes for number of passengers and whether an XL ride is requested.
- **TMUberService**: Abstract class that generalizes ride or delivery services.
- **TMUberSystemManager**: Contains the main logic of the system, tracking users, drivers, and service requests.
